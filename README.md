# HTML-Parallax-Scrolling-Timeline
Use Javascript to hijack scroll info to apply a parallax effect, see it in action [here!](https://rawgit.com/pmccolgan/HTML-Parallax-Scrolling-Timeline/master/timeline.html)

Scroll hijacking is so popular, right?  This example uses javascript to re-position divs at different speed to give a parallax effect.

Contains a timeline from 1982 to now with some personal events to the left and education/career events to the right.  Scattered in front and behind these events are empty events, these have random colours and random speeds so they move as you scroll producing the parallax.
